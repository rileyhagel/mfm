                            "Well, Gardening in the Pacific Northwest Sent from my iPhone, I actually know lots about gardening. You know, your name is kinda long. I think I'll just call you Gard. Or maybe G.I.P.N.W. Gip-En-Doubleyoo. Hmmm. Anyways, Gard, about your question, if you have pests in you garden, I have a few tricks I can teach you. First, let's determine your type of pest.<br><table><thead><tr><th>Pest Class</th><th>Pests In Said Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Large</td><td>Bears, Cougars, Montain Lions, Cougars, Pumas, Bears, Abomidimidabibul Snowman, Bigfoot, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>Squirrels, Chipmunks, Badgers, Cobras, Garter Snakes, Groundhogs, Moles, Crows, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>Flies, Gnats, Mosquitos, Wasps, Hornets, Yellow Jackets, Wasps, Yellow Jackets, Hornets, Flies, Mosquitos, etc.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>For Large and Medium class pests, I sugest the Burmese Tiger Pit:<br><img src='qa-files/burmese-tiger-pit.png' style='width: 100%'><br>For Small and Small class pests, I would use a very simple approach: Take a match (or two), and some dry grass clippings left out in the compost pile, and some gasoline. This is one of those times where gasoline can solve your problems. Whenever I have a problem, I try to think of a way to use gasoline to solve it. Now scatter the grass throughtout your garden, and soak it with gasoline. The heat will kill the pests and the larve, effectively removing the pasts. As for attracting future pests, this method also effectively removes your garden, leaving nothing to draw the attention of pests.<br>Well, I hope my solution works for you. <em>Do</em> please try this at home, and send me a video.<br><br>Sincerly,<br>Twelve"
