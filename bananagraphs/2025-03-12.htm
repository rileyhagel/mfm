                        Wait. see that one before the last one? Thats it! <strong>dragin!</strong>
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                        ware was iy? o yes, the dragin hoo lived on the hil. The braive Ser Galumphalot
                        went up to slay the evil <del>dargon</del> dragin,

                        butt the dragin ait him.
                        <img src="files/2025-03-12/draginEatsSer.png" alt="picture of the dragin eating Ser Galumphalot." title="Twelve, maybe a liiiittle less with the crayon tool..." class="illis">
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                        so then the Ser Galumphalot the Dead's son, Ser Galumphalot the Not Dead went to fite the dragin, but the dragin ait him, too. So he got named Ser Galumphalot the Also Dead.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                        so all them peasants went to fite the big bad fat dragin.
                        <img src="files/2025-03-12/angryPichforks.png" alt="The angry people, weilding pitchforks, set off to fight the dragin." title="The angry peasants set off to stab the dragin with their pitchforks." class="illis">
                        And the dragin was too full of Ser Galumphalot the Dead and Ser Galumphalot the Also Dead and Crispy Cheese Puffs and Cola that he couldnt move, so he sat down to stream a movie.
                        <img src="files/2025-03-12/draginSnacks.png" alt="a picture of the dragin watching a flatscreen TV while eating cheese puffs and drinking cola." title="the dragin snacks while watching a movie." class="illis">
                        When the people got there, he was in a foul tempr beecause he wasnt getting any internet and was yelling into the phone at the strange and elusive wizzard known as ISP Tech Support.
                        <img src="files/2025-03-12/stabbedDragin.png" alt="a pitchfork slices the dragin open, and it's contents spill out." title="I decided to not go any further with the airbrush and crayon tools, because I think it already looks good enough." class="illis">
                        So they cut the dragin open with their pichforks and Ser Galumphalot the Dead and Ser Galumphalot the Also Dead and Crispee Chese Pufs and Cola spilled owt and flowed out of the cave.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                        Aparently, the ISP Tech Support wizzard cast one of his mitey Internet Gateway Overhead Cable Fixer Truck spells, because the dragin <del>rekicked</del> rebooted his streamy thing and was watching a moovy while he sowd himself up again.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                       oh, yeah, the people fell off the cliff and landed on a bunch of spiky roks.
                        <img src="files/2025-03-12/sharpRocks.png" alt="a picture of sharp rocks mostly concealed behind a black rectangle." title="Pass me another sharpie pen, will you, Twelve?" class="illis">
